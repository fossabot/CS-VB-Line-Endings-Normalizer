# CS-VB Line Endings Normalizer (CS-VB_LINES.exe)

![CS-VB_LINES Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElektroStudios/CS-VB-Line-Endings-Normalizer/main/Images/App.ico)

### Command-line utility to normalize line endings (CRLF / CR / LF) in your C# or VB.NET source-code files.

------------------

## 👋 Introduction

**CS-VB Line Endings Normalizer** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to ensure line-ending consistency across C# (`*.cs`) and Visual Basic (`*.vb`) source code files. 

The application scans a given directory to process supported source-code files, identifying which files require normalization, and applies the requested canonical line ending style (**CRLF**, **LF**, or **CR**) using a safe, atomic file replacement operation.

## 👌 Features

- Files are read and rewritten preserving their exact text encoding, supporting UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 in both Little Endian and Big Endian, with or without a Byte Order Mark (BOM).
- Automatically skips empty files, white-space-only files, Visual Studio auto-generated files, and files with unrecognized or unsupported text encodings.
- Updates your source-code files safely by writing changes to a temporary file first, using an atomic replacement with a temporary `.bak` file to ensure data integrity.
- Supports optional recursive scanning (`-r` or `--recurse` flags).
- Provides a safe dry-run environment (`-t` or`--test` flags) to simulate changes without modifying your actual files.
- Uses [Natural sort order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order) to process files, making the program execution sequence predictable and easy to follow.

## 📝 Requirements

- Microsoft Windows OS.

## 🤖 Getting Started

Choose the installation method that best fits your workflow. You can either use the tool as a standalone portable executable or install it as a .NET Tool via NuGet.

### Option A: Standalone Executable (Portable)

This is the standard approach if you want a ready-to-use console application without relying on the .NET SDK.

1. Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/ElektroStudios/CS-VB-Line-Endings-Normalizer/releases/latest).
2. Download the latest `.zip` archive.
3. Extract the contents to your preferred directory.
4. Open your terminal and run the executable directly.

### Option B: .NET  Tool (NuGet)

If you are a developer with the .NET SDK installed, you can install the package globally. This is highly recommended as it allows you to invoke the tool directly from Visual Studio in the directory of your current solution.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global CS-VB_Line_Endings_Normalizer
```

Once installed successfully, you can invoke the tool from anywhere using its command name `CS-VB_LINES`.

## ⚙️ Usage

```bash
CS-VB_LINES.exe <directory_path> <line_ending_style> [options]
```

| Mandatory&nbsp;Arguments | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| <directory_path> | The path to the root directory containing the `*.cs` or `*.vb` source-code files to process. |
| <line_ending_style> | The target line ending formatting style to apply. Supported values are: `CRLF`, `CR`, or `LF` (case-insensitive). |

| Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **-r**,&nbsp;**--recursive** | Recursively process source-code files in all subdirectories. |
| **-t**,&nbsp;**--test** | Runs the application in Test Mode (dry-run), simulating the entire process without modifying actual files. |

### 🚀 Examples

Normalize line endings to Windows style (`CRLF`) for files in the the specified root directory:
```bash
VB_Lines_Normalizer.exe "C:\MySolution" crlf
```

Recursively normalize line endings to Unix style (`LF`) for files within the specified root directory and its subdirectories:
```bash
VB_Lines_Normalizer.exe "C:\MySolution" lf -r
```

Run a safe simulation dry-run recursively using Mac style (`CR`) to validate layout changes without modifying actual files:
```bash
VB_Lines_Normalizer.exe "C:\MySolution" cr -r --test
```
